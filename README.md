<p>Intro</p>
<p>At this game your goal is to get the king to its throne.</p>
<p>The king is accompanied by some other members of the realm such as</p>
<p>a mighty warrior, a wise old mage, and a sneaky Thief.</p>
<p>Each member of the realm holds a special ability that can help the King get to its throne.</p>
<p>To get the king to the throne you will have to use the skills of the realm members wisely.</p>


<p>Realm members abilities</p>
<p>The mighty warrior can kill those green disgusting orcs that drop keys.</p>
<p>The wise old mage had studied the elements and can now put out fire.</p>
<p>The sneaky thief can pick up keys dropped by orcs and use those keys to open gates.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the king, who has no special abilities because, well, he's a king.</p>
